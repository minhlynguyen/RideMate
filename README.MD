## RideMate version 1.0
This version of RideMate is to develop a web application to display occupance and weather infor mation for [Dublin Bikes](http://www.dublinbikes.ie).

## Introduction
The repository is for the Dublin bikes app. The website had to be shutdown LOW [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) balance
- The project scrapped data from [JCDecauxAPI](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home) and [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get data bikes data for 3 months.
- The Scrapper ran in an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) instance and stored data in an [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) ([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))
- An ML model was developed with data and deployed on a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) instance

### Features
1. Display bike stations and occupancy information on a map. 
Each bike station is a marker on the map, with its color ranges from clear (no available bike) to light blue (very few available bikes) to darker blue (more available bikes) and to red (many available bikes).
When hovering on the marker (in the shape of bike), user can see some information on the info window.

When five nearest stations to the chosen location are shown, user can click on each options to locate the station and interact with the corresponding marker.
