# RideMate version 1.0.
This version of RideMate is the work of a team of 3.
I have plan to make an upgraded version with better UI/UX and more complex features. 

## Introduction
The repository is for the Dublin bikes app. The website had to be shutdown LOW EC2 balance
- The project scrapped data from JCDecaux and open weather API to get data bikes data for 3 months.
- The Scrapper ran in an AWS EC2 instance and stored data in an AWS RDS (MySQL)
- An ML model was developed with data and deployed on a Flask instance

### This is Dublin Bikes a webapp for our DBbikes system.
